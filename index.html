	    The <a href="https://risk.berkeley.edu>">Center for Catastrophic Risk Management</a> (CCRM) at UC-Berkeley undertakes transdisciplinary research on complex organizations where disruptions and failures can have catastrophic consequences. Its research discovers ways to better identify risk mitigation strategies that ultimately improve resilience in these often large sociotechnical systems.  Since its establishment in late 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, CCRM has worked with organizations to enhance and augment their crisis and risk management strategies and approaches.  The Center is comprised of UC Berkeley faculty and students and 
	    experts and practitioners in organizational risk, resilience, and crisis management.
